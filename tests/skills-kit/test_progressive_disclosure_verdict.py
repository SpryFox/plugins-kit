"""Tests for the Dec-11 size-is-a-signal recalibration of the progressive-
disclosure check in audit.check_universal.

The framework (Dec-11) holds that the 500-line / 3000-token size threshold is
a SIGNAL that a SKILL.md deserves evaluation for a split, NOT a verdict that
splitting is correct. A split is required only if a CRP-passing decomposition
exists (sections serve different reading tasks) -- and the mechanical check
cannot evaluate CRP. So a large body with no references/ must emit
``judgment-required`` (the agent-must-judge case), never ``fail``. Emitting
FAIL was the ``hygiene_as_verdict`` anti-pattern and would push an agent to
split skills whose sections all serve one reading task.

These tests pin:
1. small body                       -> n/a   (conditional does not fire)
2. large body + references/ exists  -> pass  (split was taken)
3. large body + no references/      -> judgment-required (run the CRP test)
